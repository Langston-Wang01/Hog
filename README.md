# Hog
Hog is a dice game simulator that models two players competing to reach a target score using various strategic approaches. However, there are also three specific rules that players must abide by: Sow Sad, Boar Brawl, Sus Fuss.

This project was completed as part of UC Berkeley's CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs course.

All implementations from Problems 1-11 are entirely my own work. Problem 12 was optional.
